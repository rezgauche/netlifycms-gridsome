A large window at the street side lends itself to a view into the gallery. Yet, there is no door that gives front access. Visitors need to pass through the gate and the courtyard before entering the space, which allows for a sense of distance between persons at work and mere passersby.

Adjacent to the multi-purpose gallery/atelier there is a small communal kitchen, restrooms and an inner courtyard.

This display towards the street side has proven itself to be very useful for visual and performance artworks. The performances are viewable from the street, framed within the gallery’s window, sometimes causing consternation because of non-heteronormative interaction, lack of decent costumes, etc.

If performing happens with a public on the street side, the performance’s sound can be made audible by amplifying the indoor sound through the basement studio ventilation, making it audible outdoors.

Alternatively, by adding a curtain, then events can happen in a more relaxed intimate setting between the persons present. This is often easier when working with research, rehearsals, meetings, meditations, preparing exhibitions, etc. And if the weather allows, the courtyard is nice for gatherings, reflection, and occasional events.

Specific to this location is that nothing (creations, material, artworks, etc) can be placed in the corridors, courtyard, or outside the area of the gallery/atelier, because this obstructs the common use of the building’s occupants. That means in quotidian practice that how you make/do things has to include a consideration of any residuals of your practice. With late night events, the neighbours need to be involved somehow, and/or reduce the volume of evocative noises and music, so that the kids and early hard working adults can enjoy their beauty sleep.

In the area, Porte-de Halle, Place Bethlehem, there are lots of little restaurants, shops,  supermarkets, cultural venues (Tricoterie des Liens, Pianofabriek, Jacques-Frank) and art venues (Deborah Bowman, Alma Sarif). On walking distance there is the Wiels contemporary art center, Midi Station, Duden Parc, P.A.R.T.S, Communa asbl Maxima site, Artist Commons asbl Chassart studio, Parvis Saint-Gilles, Place Jeu de balle, etc.
